# DATA 23700

This course, the data visualization offering for students in the Data Science major, helps students build core competancies for communicating with data, including generating visualizations programmatically, writing about design and analysis choices, and learning principles and procedures for rigorous work in data science. DATA 23700 introduces students to visualization design, including theoretical frameworks for reasoning about chart construction, perceptual principles, and considerations for use of color, mapping, making data interactive, and conveying uncertainty. DATA 23700 also requires students to engage various other skill sets important in data science such as technical reading and writing, data wrangling, statistical modeling, storytelling, and producing shareable, reproducible analysis notebooks.

Completion of or placement out of DATA 11900 or CMSC 14100 is a prerequisite for taking this course. Additionally, DATA 12000 and DATA 21300 should either be completed prior to registration or taken concurrently.

Students are expected to enter the course with solid foundations in both programming and statistical modeling. At a minimum, this means that students should be comfortable writing basic algorithms and data wrangling in Python, and students should understand the mathematics behind basic regression models. Additionally, students should be comfortable picking up new programming languages as needed for coursework (e.g., installing, setting up, and self-teaching basic syntax in R or JavaScript). Students who feel unprepared to meet these requirements may find DATA 22700 (i.e., the data visualization offering for Data Science minors) a better fit. Regardless of previous preparation, both creating graphics and working with data involve many difficulties that must be confronted with patience and perserverence, but both skills will benefit students tremendously in a wide variety of endeavors. Students are encouraged to apply themselves and grow!


## Course objectives

Upon completion of the course, students should be able to:

1. Generate visualizations programmatically.
2. Apply principles of perception and statistics to visualization design. 
3. Make data visualizations interactive.
4. Avoid creating, recognize, and redesign ill-formed, ineffective, misleading, or deceptive graphics.
5. Use computational notebooks to write cogent, reproducible analyses.
6. Produce high-quality written analysis reports.


## Communication

The primary method of communication between students and instructional staff will be email.

## Coursework

Deliverables for this course include 5 assignments and 1 final project. Additionally, there will be participation points awarded for 12 exercises and 6 in-class quizes. 

### Assignments

Assignments are summative assessments of core learning objectives in the course. Each assignment involves analyzing and visualizing a specific dataset (often provided by the instructor). Students are expected to create orginal work; collaboration or copying from any source is not allowed. Assignments are evaluated based on both the *quality of visualizations* produced as well as the *quality of write-ups* explaining the analysis and design rationale. 

Assignment 2 is distinct from the others insofar as it is a project proposal, which serves as checkpoint for whether students have a promising a feasible project idea. This is not a summative assessment but a prospective one. It provides an opportunity to workshop ideas for the project, but it offers no guarantees about the subsequent project grade. It will be treated the same as other assignments for grading and resubmission purposes.

### Project

The project serves the purpose of a final in DATA 23700. The project involves choosing and analyzing dataset and producing a written technical report about the analysis. Students are expected to create orginal work; collaboration or copying from any source is not allowed. The project is evaluated on the following criteria:

- Choice of dataset
- Quality of analysis
- Quality of visualizations
- Quality of write-up

### Participation

Participation is at the core of DATA 23700 and is weighed strongly in grading. There will be many opportunities to earn participation credit throughout the quarter, and students are expected to take these opportunities in order to keep pace with the course. Participation will be evaluated through *participation points* awarded for successfully completing exercises and being present for in-class quizes. 

Exercises are opportunities for skill-building, practice, and collaboration. Exercises begin during class time, but students may need to spend time completing them at home. Exercises usually involve a few specific tasks, including reading technical specifications, writing code, and documenting work. Exercises are evaluated on *completeness and following directions*. No partial credit will be awarded for exercises. Exercises that are late, incomplete, or which do not follow directions will not receive points.

In-class quizes serve as an attendance mechanism. They will not be announced in advance, with the exception of the syllabus quiz during our first session. Instead, they will be pop quizes for which students must attend class to receive points. Quizes will be very short and evaluated on *completeness but not correctness*. Students not present in class when a quiz is administered will not have the option to make up missed points.


## Evaluation

We use a form of grading known as *specifications grading* in this course. The goal of specifications grading is to help students focus on their mastery of the material and identify areas for improvement as the quarter progresses. Students are encouraged to focus on skills, not on scores.

Final grades will be determined based on participation, assignments, and the project.

### Assignments and the project

Assignments and the project will be evaluated using an S/N/U scale:

- **Satisfactory (S)**: The student demonstrates sufficient mastery of the material. The standard for earning a score of S is high, reflecting the intructor's expectations for student work.
- **Needs Improvement (N)**: The student has put in a good-faith effort to do the work, but revealed a lack of mastery of the material that can be addressed via concrete feedback. Work must be relatively complete and follow directions to earn a score of N.
- **Ungradable (U)**: The student did not submit any work, did not follow directions, or did not complete a sufficient portion of the work assigned (e.g., completed less than half the work).

When reviewing **assignments**, we evaluate both: 

- *Quality of visualizations* including but not limited to design choices such as encodings, transformations, and scales. 
- *Quality of write-up* including but not limited to clear communication, logical arguments, and cogent rationales for design and analysis choices.

When reviewing the **project**, we evaluate for:

- *Choice of dataset* including but not limited to whether the dataset can answer the questions the student poses, support a narrative, and enable visualizations that demonstrate the skills learned throughout the course.
- *Quality of analysis* including but not limited to whether analysis choices are statistically valid, whether the analysis is robust to arbitrary analysis choices, and whether analysis choices are documented, justified, and reproducible.  
- *Quality of visualizations* including but not limited to design choices such as encodings, transformations, and scales. 
- *Quality of write-up* including but not limited to the rhetorical cohesion of the write-up with the analysis, clear communication, logical arguments, and cogent rationales for design and analysis choices.

The specifications for each assignment and the project include more precise descriptions of what is expected for a score of Satisfactory.

There are a total of 10 S/N/U scores for assignments. Every assignment has two S/N/U scores, one assigned for quality of visualization and a second for quality of write-up. 

There are a total of 4 S/N/U scores for the project, assigned for choice of dataset, quality of analysis, quality of visualizations, and quality of write-up, respectively.

### Exercises and Quizes

Exercises and quizes evaluate whether a student is keeping up with the course. They are scored with **participation points**, which add up over the quarter to determine what grade a student is eligible for (see Final grades). Exercises are intended as low-stakes opportunities to practice, and students should attempt all of them. Quizes are indended to incentivize attendance.

Exercises provide the majority of the participation points that a student can earn in DATA 23700. Exercises will be graded on *completeness and following directions*. Exercises must be turned in on time to receive credit. No partial credit will be awarded for exercises.

Quizes provide additional opportunities to earn participation points. Quizes are graded based on *whether a student was present in class and submits them*. Students will not be allowed to make up participation points for missed quizes.

There are a total of 12 participation points for exercises and 6 participation points for quizes. Each exercise and quizes are worth one participation point. A couple of especially challenging exercises may award additional participation points to incentivize performance.

### Final grades

In total, students can receive up to 14 S/N/U scores and 18 participation points.

Final grades are based on the following set of tables. Within each table, final grades are listed by the number of Satisfactory scores and Needs improvement scores. Participation points determine what table a student should use to look up their grade. There are three tables for three levels of participation: 

**Full Participation (14-18 participation points)**: Students who participate fully in class will have the opportunty to earn an A and will be graded on the most lenient scale.

| Minimum S Required | Minimum N (+ extra S) Required | Final Grade | 
| :----------------- | :----------------------------- | :---------- |
| 14                 | 0                              | A           |
| 12                 | 2                              | A           |
| 12                 | 0                              | A-          |
| 10                 | 2                              | B+          |
| 10                 | 0                              | B           |
|  8                 | 4                              | B-          |
|  8                 | 0                              | C+          |
|  6 and below       | NA                             | D           |

**Grade Table for Partial Participation (9-13 participation points)**: Students who miss more than a few, but not too many, participation points will be graded on a less lenient scale. They must get higher S/N/U scores to earn a comparable grade.

| Minimum S Required | Minimum N (+ extra S) Required | Final Grade | 
| :----------------- | :----------------------------- | :---------- |
| 14                 | 0                              | A-          |
| 12                 | 2                              | B+          |
| 12                 | 0                              | B           |
| 10                 | 2                              | B-          |
| 10                 | 0                              | C+          |
|  8                 | 4                              | C           |
|  8                 | 0                              | C-          |
|  6 and below       | NA                             | F           |

**Grade Table for Low Participation (0-8 participation points)**: Students who miss most of the available participation points will not be eligible for a high passing grade and must earn high S/N/U scores to pass the course.

| Minimum S Required | Minimum N (+ extra S) Required | Final Grade | 
| :----------------- | :----------------------------- | :---------- |
| 14                 | 0                              | B           |
| 12                 | 2                              | B-          |
| 12                 | 0                              | C+          |
| 10                 | 2                              | C           |
| 10                 | 0                              | C-          |
|  8                 | 4                              | D           |
|  8                 | 0                              | D           |
|  6 and below       | NA                             | F           |

Consider some examples:

- A student with 14 participation points, 12 S, and 2 N would get an A
- A student with 12 participation points, 14 S, and 0 N would get an A-
- A student with 15 participation points, 10 S, and 3 N would get a B+
- A student with 7 participation points, 14 S, and 0 N would get a B
- A student with 10 participation points, 10 S, and 3 N would get a B-
- A student with 13 participation points, 10 S, and 0 N would get a C+
- A student with 14 participation points, 6 S, and 0 N would get a D
- A student with 9 participation points, 6 S, and 2 N would get an F

**Advice for success**: The grading scheme in this class emphasizes *completing coursework on time*. It is much better to turn in work that is an imperfect but thorough attempt than to turn in nothing at all. Students can earn a healthy buffer for their final grade by submitting exercises on time and being present in class for quizes.

### Resubmissions

Assignments only (*not exercises or the project*) may be resubmitted one time each. If a student receives a score of N or U on an assignment, *they may resubmit that assignment one time for a score bump of up to one increment*. In other words, a resubmission can raise a N to a S or raise a U to a N, but a resubmission cannot raise a U to a S. Thus, students should always make an earnest attempt to submit something relatively complete on time rather than missing deadlines. 

**How to resubmit?** Students *resubmitting an assignment that at first earned a N* should visit office hours prepared to present their revised work to the instructor or a TA and explain how they responded to feedback. Resubmissions that at first earned a N may not be submitted without visiting office hours. Students *resubmitting an assignment that at first earned a U* should send their instructor a new submission via email, in the required file format(s), within the allotted timeline (see below).

**Conditions on resubmitting:** 

- Students wishing to resubmit an assignment must do so *within three weeks of the assignment's due date*. 
- The last day for resubmissions is Friday December 5, and no resubmissions will be accepted after this date.
- Students may not resubmit the same assignment more than one time.
- A score bump upon resubmission is subject to the same standards as the original round of grading, e.g., the expectation for an S is still high. *Not all resubmissions are guaranteed a score bump.*

### Late policy

Late submissions are not accepted in this class, except under specific circumstances (see below). Exercises, assignments, and the project have hard due dates, which students must adhere to. These deadlines are in place to pace the workload of DATA 23700 appropriately and to provide a fair system of accountability. Please bear in mind that the grading scheme for this class (with resubmissions) is set up to absorb a reasonable amount of sub-par work. Turning in something unpolished is much better than not turning in anything at all.

Exceptions to the no late work policy:

- **Resubmissions**: Students may resubmit each assignment once, within three weeks of that assignment's due date (see above). Resubmitted assignments can receive a score change of only one increment, i.e., U to N or N to S. *Resubmission cannot be used for exercises or the project.*
- **SDS Accommodations**: Students with formal disability accommodations may be entitled to extra time on assignments. 
- **Emergencies**: If you have an emergency and feel it warrants an exception to the no late work policy, you should first be in contact with your College advisor, as the College should be aware of the emergency and ensure that any proper university or department policies are followed if needed (e.g., an injury might require Student Disability Services accommodations). Emergencies entail conditions beyond the student's control that make it infeasible for them to complete coursework on time. This policy is not intended to provide relief for failures of time management. Once students have contacted their College advisor, they should contact their instructor via email with a CC to their College advisor. Your instructor does not need to know the details of your emergency, but they do need your College advisor to confirm that your situation qualifies as an emergency. Contacting us as early as is practical given the emergency makes the process of accommodating your situation work more smoothly for everyone. We care about your well-being and success in the class, and have put these policies in place to be fair and give students agency.

No other exceptions will be made.

### Grade disputes

Students may not dispute scores and grades assigned in DATA 23700. The score on a piece of work reflects the course staff's feedback on a student's level of mastery, and students should take it as an opportunity to understand areas for improvement. Students are encouraged to ask the course staff for concrete advice about how to improve submitted work. The instructor and TAs are happy to have these kinds of conversations with students, including going over your code or writing. On the other hand, we will not entertain requests to change scores because a student feels their work deserved a higher score or disagrees with the grading process.

There is **one exception** to the no grade disputes policy: if a grader made a *factual mistake*. Please note that this only includes cases where a grader makes an erroneous statement about your code or writing in their feedback. It does not include cases where students disagree with whether something deserves to be flagged as incorrect.

For example, suppose a student receives a piece of feedback that says "Poor choice of encoding for data type: Student used a part-to-whole representation for non-proportion data”. If the encoded data in question was actually proportion data, and the grader missed this fact (and erroneously gave you that feedback), you can ask the instructor or a TA to review this decision. Please note that, even if the feedback is amended, it may not affect the score assigned depending on how many other issues were identified in your work.

We ask that students keep these requests brief and to the point: no more than a few sentences identifying the exact statement that the grader made and the reasons the student believes the statement was mistaken, including references to specific parts of the submitted code or writing (e.g., “I said that these are proportion data in paragraph 2 of the submitted report.”). Focus on laying out the facts, and nothing else. **Regrade requests should be submitted through Gradescope, not via email.**

Regrade requests are distinct from assignment resubmissions (see above).

Finally, it is also a student's responsibility to make these requests in a timely manner. **Requests to review grading mistakes must be submitted no later than one week after a graded piece of work is returned to you.** After that time, we will not consider any such requests. We will not accept any request to review grading after **Thursday December 11** because grades are due soon after; this may limit grade disputes for the last few exercises and the project.


## Software tools

Students in DATA 23700 are expected to take responsibility for filling in gaps in their understanding of any software they use to complete their coursework. This goes especially for students who are new to a given programming language or software tool.

Most work in this class will be conducted using computational notebooks, other text files, and graphics editing tools. We will demonstrate how to work with computational notebooks in VS Code and RStudio, but students may choose to use a different programming environment or text editor if they want (e.g., Google Colab). We will cover a handful of APIs in Python, R, and JavaScript, and students must use these to complete their coursework as instructed. We may also briefly introduce graphics editing software such as Figma or Adobe Illustrator. *Students are responsible for learning to use and troubleshoot whatever software tools they adopt to complete their coursework, including installation and setup on a students personal computer.*

Course staff will not help you install software or troubleshoot environment setup issues since these problems are tangential to our learning objectives, and students who are adequately prepared for the course should be able to navigate these kinds of problems independently.


## Generative AI policy

The goals of this class are to help students learn the essentials of data visualization, analysis, and communication.While generative AI can be helpful for boosting productivity at boilerplate tasks during coding or writing, we find that over-relying on tools like ChatGPT or CoPilot can undermine a student's learning of fundamental skills and concepts. Further, it can diminish a student's capacity for deep thinking and critical problem solving by offloading the intellectual struggle inherent to creative work. For these reasons, *students are forbidden from using generative AI to complete coursework for them (e.g., pasting assignment prompts into ChatGPT, using ChatGPT to write the project)*. While we discourage the use of generative AI, we do not prohibit it entirely. We recognize their are legitimate uses of this technology that students may wish to practice through their coursework. Be extremely cautious when using such tools, as they have no sense of what is correct or true and may produce plausible-looking code or writing that contains errors. 

*The following are the only permissible uses of generative AI*:

- Students may use autocomplete tools such as CoPilot to complete individual lines of code, as long as students understand exactly what that line of code is producing. Students should exercise caution when repeatedly using this functionality (i.e., generating several lines one after the other). 
- If students don't understand what a piece of code is doing (e.g., a piece of code provided by the instuctors or found in an online example), students can ask a generative AI questions about that code. Students should follow up on these explanations by looking up key pieces of syntax in the API documentation.
- Students may ask generative AI to review their work (e.g., giving feedback on code or writing, helping to diagnose bugs in code or issues with the flow of a written argument). If generative AI suggests an alternative, the student should use this to inform their own thinking and then manually revise their own solution.

*The following are NOT permissible uses of generative AI*:
- Students may not use generative AI for any part of any write-up, including analysis or design rationales (you must describe what you did with your own words).
- Generating more than 5 lines of code at a time from a generative model is not allowed.
- The generative model should not be used to solve the main intellectual aspect of any coursework, such as proposing a project idea or a solution to assigments.
- Presenting the outputs of generative AI as one’s own work, without explicit citation and acknowledgment of what specifically was used from such models is not allowed. This includes presenting AI-generated code or writing revisions as a students own work.


## Code of conduct

**Diversity and Inclusion**: Students are expected to treat each other with respect and to give due consideration to each other's stances and positions. Discrimination of any kind will not be tolerated, along the lines of gender identity, sexuality, disability, generational status, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, religion, national origin, culture, or otherwise. Please see the UChicago [Commitment on Diversity](https://diversityandinclusion.uchicago.edu/commitment/). Additionally, we are committed to providing equitable access to education at UChicago. Students who have been approved for academic accommodations through [Student Disability Services (SDS)](https://disabilities.uchicago.edu/) should follow the procedures established by SDS for using accommodations. Regardless of identity or status with SDS, students with concerns or questions about issues of diversity and inclusion should email the instructor.

**Academic Integrity**: We take academic honesty very seriously in this class. Students must be in class to receive participation points for quizes, and any efforts to collaborate with classmates to subvert this attendance mechanism are an academic honesty violation. Further, students must not collaborate or copy from outside sources on non-collaborative work such as assignments and the project. Collaboration is allowed on *exercises only*, but students must turn in their own copy of the work as instructed. Students are not permitted to use automated assistants such as *ChatGPT* or *GitHub CoPilot* to do their coursework for them (see above), and misrepresenting AI-generated content as student work is an academic honesty violation. Additionally, students should be aware of the UChicago policy on [Academic Honesty and Plagiarism](https://studentmanual.uchicago.edu/academic-policies/academic-honesty-plagiarism/). The gist of academic integrity is that you should always do and submit your own work.

**Sexual Misconduct**: Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, including sexual assault, sexual abuse, sexual harassment, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. Sexual misconduct is completely unacceptable at UChicago (and anywhere else), including any interactions that occur related to this course. For related resources, please see the UChicago website about [Title IX and Sexual Misconduct](https://equalopportunityprograms.uchicago.edu/title-ix-and-university-policy/). Students seeking help or guidance related to an incident of sexual misconduct will be supported. Students should be aware that, in certain situations, the University may have an institutional obligation to respond to a report of sexual misconduct and that, as a faculty member, *your instructor is required by Title IX and the University of Chicago to report incidents of sexual misconduct*, even if students request to keep the information confidential. If you would like to speak to someone confidentially about an incident of sexual misconduct, please see the University's [Confidential Resources](https://equalopportunityprograms.uchicago.edu/confidential-resources/).

**Student Health and Wellness**: Student's mental and physical health are of primary importance both for reasons of common human dignity and to create a suitable learning environment at UChicago. If you or someone you know needs or might benefit from mental health services, please consider reaching out to [UChicago Student Wellness](https://wellness.uchicago.edu/mental-health/), whose services do not come at any additional cost to students.

**If you are sick, please do not come to class or in-person office hours.** If you need to miss class because of an illness, please email your instructor. Students who have been exposed to or who are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 should contact [UChicago Student Wellness](https://wellness.uchicago.edu/) to be tested. Other public health concerns should be directed to [UCAIR](https://ucair.uchicago.edu/). If there is an emergency, please call 773-702-8181 or dial 123 on any campus phone, or call 911 for emergency response.

**Attendance and Participation**: DATA 23700 is 100% in-person. However, if students need to miss class for some reason, they will be able to access lecture slides on Canvas, and they are encouraged to ask peers to share notes from the missed class. With a few expections on days when we do exercises in a flipped classroom, lectures will not be recorded. The instructor and TAs are happy to discuss what was missed during office hours. Please do not email the instructional staff with requests for a summary of missed lectures; we will tell you to ask a peer for notes and/or visit us at office hours. *Students who miss an in-class exercise are still expected to turn that exercise in for credit. Missed quizes cannot be made up.*
