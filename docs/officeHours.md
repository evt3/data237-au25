## Communication

The primary method of communication between students and instructional staff will be email.

Instructor: **Alex Kale** - kalea@uchicago.edu

TA: **Krisha Mehta** - krisha@uchicago.edu

TA: **Danni Liu** - danni6@uchicago.edu

We will not be relying on EdTech systems like EdStem. We will use Canvas only to link to course content like the course webpage and GitHub repo.

### Class sessions

We will hold class **Tuesday and Thursday 12:30 PM - 1:50 PM in Ryerson 276**.

### Office hours

Students seeking help with concepts or coursework should plan to attend office hours. We will hold the following office hours each week unless posted otherwise.

**Office hours begin on September 29 and end on December 5.**

Due to conference travel, **Alex will be unavailable November 2-7**. Because of this, we will use scheduled class time for project check-ins with the TAs on November 4 and 6.

### Materials, turn-in, and gradebook

All course materials can be found on the course website, GitHub repo, and Canvas. The [course website](https://kalealex.github.io/data237-au25/) contains information on policies and schedule, and links to additional resources such as readings. The course [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kalealex/data237-au25/) contains intructions and code for all coursework, in-class activities, and demos. [Canvas](https://canvas.uchicago.edu/courses/66904) is where we will post PDFs of lecture slides and (only for sessions where we have a flipped classroom) pre-recorded lectures.

Student work will be turned in via [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/1143479), where students will be able to view grades and feedback on coursework.
