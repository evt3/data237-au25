## Communication

The primary method of communication between students and instructional staff will be email.

Instructor: **Alex Kale** - kalea@uchicago.edu

TA: **Krisha Mehta** - krisha@uchicago.edu

TA: **Danni Liu** - danni6@uchicago.edu

We will not be relying on EdTech systems like EdStem. We will use Canvas only to link to course content like the course webpage and GitHub repo.

### Class sessions

Due to conference travel, **Alex will be unavailable November 2-7**. Because of this, we will use scheduled class time for project check-ins with the TAs on November 4 and 6.

### Materials, turn-in, and gradebook

All course materials can be found on the course website, GitHub repo, and Canvas. The [course website](__) contains information on policies and schedule, and links to additional resources such as readings. The course [GitHub repo](__) contains intructions and code for all coursework, in-class activities, and demos. [Canvas](__) is where we will post PDFs of lecture slides and (only for sessions where we have a flipped classroom) pre-recorded lectures.

Student work will be turned in via [Gradescope](__), where students will be able to view grades and feedback on coursework.
